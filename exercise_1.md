## Machine Problem: Grade Calculator

**Objective:**  
Write a Python function called `grade_calculator` that determines the letter grade of a student based on their average score.

**Instructions:**

1. The function will accept one argument: 
    - The average score (a numerical value between 0 and 100).
2. Use variables to store the letter grade.
3. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to determine the grade:
    - 90 and above: 'A'
    - 80 to 89: 'B'
    - 70 to 79: 'C'
    - 60 to 69: 'D'
    - Below 60: 'F'
4. If the input is outside the range 0-100, return "Invalid Score".
5. The function should return the letter grade.
